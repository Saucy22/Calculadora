This is literally just a program i made to test out coding in python, not a serious project.
This calculator has four functions (adding, subtracting, multiplication and division)
The .Sh file only works on linux operating systems because i was too lazy to make an .exe file for this.
The .Sh file executes calcexec.py, if you'd like to execute this program on another os, use the calc.py file in some python interpreter.
